# Final Project of the IBM Professional Certificate in SQL course.

Welcome to my final project for the IBM Professional Certificate in SQL course! In this repository, you will find the outcome of my efforts and learning throughout the course, focusing on SQL queries and database manipulation.

### Objective:

The purpose of this project is to put into practice the knowledge acquired during the course, working with different databases provided in the lab. From basic queries to challenges involving subqueries, I aimed to explore and practice a wide variety of SQL skills and techniques, made available through several hands-on projects by IBM.

### What you will find:
- Simple and intermediate SQL queries.
- Advanced use of subqueries and joins to work with related data.
- Realistic approach, reflecting scenarios from the professional world.


Feel free to explore the files, review the code, and check the query results. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to get in touch. Thank you for following my progress in this project, and I hope it can also be useful for other students of the SQL course! :)
